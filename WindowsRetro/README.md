# Retro Website
### Cristian CÃ¡zares
## A Windows NT inspirated website

Plain HTML + CSS to make an interface inspired by the Windows NT style (~1993).<br>
It shows a taskbar, of which all the options except "Start" and "About" are links to external pages. <br>
"Start" is disabled as its only purpose is visual. <br>
"About" displays a window in the "emulated desktop". To do this interaction, it is used jQuery, in particular its selector. In addition, there's a Bootstrap button due to requirements. <br>
